# memory-match
My take on the classic game of memory. Flip two cards, try to match as many as possible. Written in Javascript/jQuery

Directions:
Select two cards to reveal the images behind them. If the cards match, you score points. If they don't you lose a turn!
You gain additional points and turns for making consecutive matches in a row. The game ends when you successfully match
all the cards or run out of turns.
